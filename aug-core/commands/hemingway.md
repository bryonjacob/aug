description: Apply hemingwayesque principles to rewrite content concisely
---

Apply hemingwayesque skill to user's content. Ruthlessly cut words. Every word earns its place.

## Instructions

1. Load hemingwayesque skill principles
2. Get user's content (provided as argument or ask)
3. Apply principles:
   - Active voice, present tense
   - Remove filler words
   - Concrete over abstract
   - Delete redundancy
   - Prefer short words
   - One idea per sentence
   - Cut ceremony
   - Lists over prose

4. Rewrite content following hemingwayesque principles
5. Show original word count vs new word count
6. Present rewritten version
7. Explain key changes (briefly - stay hemingwayesque)

## Usage Examples

```bash
/hemingway "I would like to request that you help me understand how the authentication system works"

/hemingway "Rewrite this skill description to be more concise"

/hemingway "Write a prompt for analyzing code complexity and identifying areas that might benefit from refactoring"
```

## Output Format

**Original:** [X words]
[original content]

**Rewritten:** [Y words] (Z% reduction)
[hemingway version]

**Key changes:**
- [Brief list of main edits]

## Notes

- Target 30-50% word reduction
- Preserve meaning precisely
- Break rules only for technical precision or preventing ambiguity
- If content already hemingwayesque, say so
